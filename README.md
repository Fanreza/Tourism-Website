# Tourism-Website
a small project I worked on for my uncle


# Some information regarding this program

**Made with** <br>
Bootstrap 5
PHP 7.4.9 

**Important** <br
• Make sure the order of the javascript has not changed 
  Jquery  
  Popper
  Bootstrap.min.js

• Pay Attention to Connections to assets
  I have two connections for assets like css and javascript, specifically bootstrap
  
  1.	Javascript
  2.	CSS
  3.	OpenGraph
  
    
  I have a problem with opengraph, namely the web hosting that I use, for some reason it can't display opengraph, so I use heroku to test my website opengraph. 
  
  Make sure to only use one of them, I do this because the internet at my home is not good, therefore for development I use all assets in offline form, and to deploy     using a CDN for better website performance.
